                        <b>Ivory Coast</b> is a stunner, shingled with starfish-studded sands, palm-tree forests and roads so
                        orange they resemble strips of bronzing powder. This is a true tropical paradise, and a country
                        that is moving towards economic progress – it's a nation that is modernizing its lifestyle and
                        culture, but managing to do so without losing its identity.

                            Some of the buildings of Le Plateau are as breathtaking up close as from a distance. La
                            Pyramide, designed by the Italian architect Rinaldo Olivieri and built between 1970 and
                            1973, was the first daring structure and is considered a highlight of African modernism in
                            architecture. A concrete pyramid striped horizontally with balconies, it rests upon a
                            gigantic cubic pillar, lifting itself over the city's skyline.<br><br>
                            The building housed expats and other Abidjan elite in the body of the pyramid, while the
                            ground floor was reserved for commercial purposes. It deteriorated significantly in the
                            1990s, however, when it was deserted at the onset of political troubles. It is still waiting
                            for renovation.
