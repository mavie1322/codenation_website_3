                    <p><strong>Cameroon</strong> is Africa's throbbing heart, a sultry mosaic of active volcanoes,
                        white-sand beaches, thick rainforest and magnificent parched landscapes broken up by the bizarre
                        rock formations of the Sahel. With both Francophone and Anglophone regions, not to mention some
                        250 local languages, the country is a vast ethnic and linguistic jigsaw, yet one that, in
                        contrast to so many of its neighbors, enjoys a great deal of stability.<br>
                        <br>With reasonable road infrastructure, travel is a lot easier here than in many parts of
                        Africa. Still, you'll miss none of those indicators that you're in the middle of this
                        fascinating continent: everyone seems to be carrying something on their heads, <b><i>makossa</i></b>
                        music sets the rhythm, the street smells like roasting plantains and African bliss is just a
                        piece of grilled fish and a sweating beer away.

                        <p>The Chutes de la Lobé are an impressive set of waterfalls that empty directly into the sea.
                            It's a beautiful sight. Take a moto-taxi (CFA500), or make a trip with Urbain Mandoua, who
                            can arrange a lunch of sole, shrimps and plantains on the beach. The beach itself is
                            idyllic, with log seats and hammocks under the trees.</p><br>

                        <p>
                            The Dja Faunal Reserve was created in 1950 and became a World Heritage Site in 1987 and it
                            forms an integral part of the dense rain forests that make up the Congo Basin. The Dja
                            Faunal Reserve is one of the largest areas of protected rainforest in Africa. 90% of the
                            reserve consists of unspoiled and protected forest marked out by the Dja River which acts as
                            a natural border for the area. The reserve is home to 107 mammals including a large variety
                            of primates, for which the reserve is best known.
                            <br>The area is not too easy to access and a local guide is advisable.

                        <p><b>Fon Palace</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Just north of Bamenda is the large Tikar community of Bafut, traditionally the most powerful
                            of the Grassfields kingdoms. The fon's (local chief's) palace here is home to the
                            representative of a 700-year-old dynasty and is a fascinating insight into Cameroon's
                            traditional culture.<br>
                            The palace compound consists of numerous buildings, including the houses of the fon's
                            150-or-so wives (not all of whom are presently in residence), and the sacred Achum building,
                            a shrine which is off-limits to everyone except the fon and his close advisors. In front of
                            the palace compound are several stones marking the burial sites of nobles who died while
                            serving the fon, and the Takombang House which holds the fon's ceremonial drum.<br>
                            The imposing colonial building above the palace is now a museum. It holds many interesting
                            (and slightly scary) carvings, traditional costumes and weapons.
